# tdd-fibonacci

TDD JavaScript implementation of Fibonacci series function

## What is this project about?

This project demonstrates a [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD) approach to writing a JavaScript function to calculate a given element of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

## How?

Firstly, fork this repo. Clone it locally, and then run `npm install`.

And secondly, step through the slides at [mcalthrop.github.io/tdd-fibonacci](http://mcalthrop.github.io/tdd-fibonacci/#1), modifying your cloned repo as you go.

## What tools are used?

The following npm modules are used:

- [karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) for the test runner
- [chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/) for the expectation library
- [mocha](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started) for the test framework and reporter
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for the browser to run the tests in
- [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/) to modularise the code
